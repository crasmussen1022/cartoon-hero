		<h2>About Groot</h2>
		<p>Groot is not a tree. He is a Flora colossus. The Marvel Cinematic Universe introduced Groot as an intergalactic bounty hunter who works alongside his partner, a modified raccoon named Rocket. Following an unsuccessful bounty hunt, Groot and Rocket spiral into a series of adventures to protect the galaxy from evil-doers with new friends they've met along the way.</p>
